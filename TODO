bug: multithreaded environment breaks RepeatedRecordHandler (doesn't print
     number of missed lines); this might be a general bug with
     RepeatedRecordHandler
bug: RepeatedRecordHandler thinks that empty tracks are still seen (prints
     the "repeated messages" message)
bug: Approximate repeated record prints wrong repeat count on top-level log
     messages
bug: In multithreaded environment, time a track took is time from begin to
     print, not begin to end (the latter is, in general, shorter).

feature: tests. they don't exist right now.
feature: stack trace appending should maybe be a handler (for efficiency)
feature: prevent interleaving of stdout/stderr (if doable...maybe via locking)
feature: support for automatically assigning channels from calling
         class/method
feature: convert the main() method into an ITest

ideas for new handlers:
  - record histogram of messages, tell you about frequent log messages when
    program ends
  - if messages match certain criteria, dump a stack trace (for tracking down
    random print statements)
  - basic filtering: filter messages if they match certain channels, source
    methods, are inside a specific track, etc.
